name: grill-me
description: Relentlessly stress-test an existing plan or design by interviewing the user about its failure modes, edge cases, and weak assumptions. The adversarial, plan-already-exists counterpart to ask-me's intent-forming interview. Use when the user wants a plan, design, or approach pressure-tested before building it, or uses trigger phrases like "grill me" or invokes /grill-me directly.

# Grill Me

A relentless interview for **finding the holes in a plan that already exists**.
Where `ask-me` comes first to discover and sharpen intent, `grill-me` comes
after: it exists to break a concrete plan before reality does.

## When to use this skill

- The user has a plan, design, or approach in hand and wants it pressure-tested
  before implementation starts.
- A plan looks plausible on its face but hasn't been checked against edge
  cases, invariants, or the parts of the spec it touches.
- The user explicitly invokes `/grill-me` or says a trigger phrase like
  "grill me".

Do not use this skill when there's no plan yet to grill — a fuzzy or
unformed idea should go through `ask-me`/`asking` first. Grilling an idea
that hasn't been shaped yet just produces noise; grill the plan once it
exists.

## How this differs from asking

| | `grill-me` | `ask-me` |
|---|---|---|
| Timing | After a plan/design exists | Before a plan exists |
| Tone | Skeptical, adversarial | Curious, exploratory |
| Goal | Find holes and failure modes | Discover and sharpen intent |
| Question shape | "What breaks if X happens?" | "What matters to you here, and why?" |

If the user is still deciding *what* to build, prefer `ask-me`/`asking`
instead. If the shape of the thing is already decided and the question is
whether it survives contact with reality, use this skill.

## Process

1. **Read the plan and its context first.** Understand exactly what is being
   proposed, and read the parts of `SPEC.md` and `AGENTS.md` it touches —
   especially the invariants (`INV-1`..`INV-5`, `AGENTS.md` §2) — before
   attacking it. A challenge that ignores an already-stated constraint just
   wastes the user's time.

2. **Ask one hard question at a time, in plain chat.** This repo's own
   convention (see `CLAUDE.md`, "Asking questions") applies here too:
   - Ask **one question per turn**, as regular chat text — never the
     multiple-choice / question-picker tool.
   - Where useful, offer 2–4 concrete answer shapes the user can pick from
     or riff on, but the point of a grill is to make them think, not to make
     picking easy — don't soften a question just to fit a tidy option list.
   - Wait for the answer before moving to the next question. Let a weak
     answer draw a sharper follow-up on the same point rather than moving on.

3. **Interview at the level of concrete failure, not vibes.** Aim for
   roughly 5–10 questions, drawn from categories like:
   - **Edge cases** — What's the smallest/largest/emptiest/most malformed
     input this has to survive? What happens at zero, one, and "too many"?
   - **Invariant checks** — Does this plan hold every invariant the spec
     requires, or does it quietly assume one away?
   - **Failure modes** — What's the first thing that breaks under load, bad
     data, or a step done out of order? How would you *know* it broke?
   - **Assumptions** — What is this plan silently assuming about the caller,
     the data, or the environment that might not hold?
   - **Reversibility** — If this turns out wrong after it ships, how costly
     is it to undo or change?
   - **Alternatives** — What's the next-best approach that was rejected, and
     why does this one actually beat it rather than just being first to mind?
   - **Blast radius** — What else in the codebase (or `SPEC.md` sections)
     does this plan touch or constrain that isn't obvious from the plan
     itself?

   Skip categories the plan already addresses explicitly and correctly.
   Tailor wording to the specific plan — don't recite this list verbatim.

4. **Press on weak answers.** If an answer is hand-wavy ("that shouldn't
   happen", "we'll deal with it later"), don't accept it and move on — ask
   what makes that true, or what the cost is if it's wrong. The goal is a
   plan that's actually been tested, not one that's survived polite
   questions.

5. **Summarize the damage.** After the interview, list concretely what
   changed or firmed up as a result: which assumptions got confirmed, which
   got revised, and which gaps are still open and need a decision before
   building. Don't declare the plan "sound" — report what it survived and
   what it didn't.

6. **Hand off.** Once the plan has been sharpened (or the user decides an
   open gap needs to go back to `ask-me` because the *intent* underneath it
   was never actually settled), proceed into implementation scoped to the
   sharpened plan — not a larger rewrite prompted by the grilling itself.

## Notes for this repo

- This repo builds via scheduled agent tasks working one build-order step at
  a time (see `CLAUDE.md`, "Before you start"). Grill the plan for *that*
  issue's acceptance criteria — a grilling session is not license to expand
  scope into later build-order steps, even when the interview surfaces a
  legitimately good idea for one.
- If grilling surfaces a real gap outside the current issue's scope (a spec
  ambiguity, a missing invariant test, an idea for later), don't fold it into
  the current plan — file it per `docs/issue-standards.md` instead.
